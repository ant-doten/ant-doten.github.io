## Introduction

Hello viewer, and thank you for checking out this page. On this site, you’ll find information for NAU course PLD450, Applied IT Project. This project looks at a hypothetical situation an organization is facing with mobile devices.

## Mobile Device Management (MDM) - Background

Mobile devices in the workplace can be an incredibly powerful tool that can transform our workplaces. Today, many employees own a form of mobile device that is continuously available to them (e.g., smartphone, tablet, etc.) To facilitate seamless delivery of business resources to an employee’s device, Information Technology has implemented a proof of concept pilot program at the directive of leadership to see how Mobile Device Management (MDM) will work within the organization. Below, you’ll find information on enrolling your device into this pilot program. (Information shown is hypothetical and based off of a live production environment.)

## Information Technology – MDM Pilot Program

On the side columns of this site, you’ll find a ‘Self-Enrollment’ page. Within this page, you’ll find two entries (i.e., Android, Apple); based on your device manufacturer, please select the corresponding entry, and you’ll discover an on-screen walkthrough for enrolling your device into our MDM pilot program.
