####  Q: What is Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)?
{: .fs-4 }

##### A: BYOD or Bring-Your-Own-Device is a type of Mobile Device Management (MDM) that allows IT to provide corporate resources to employee mobile devices securely. BYOD works by having an employee enroll their devices into our Mobile Device Management (MDM) platform. Unlike, our corporate-owned devices that are under organizational supervision, BYOD provides an employee with complete control over their device while enrolled in our MDM platform. If an employee leaves the organization, they can easily un-enroll their device from our platform without affecting their devices data. The only information that will be removed during an employee’s un-enrollment will be corporate data and resources. This type of connectivity allows the employee to be in complete control of their device while still having the ability to receive corporate resources. An added benefit of BYOD is that employees wil no longer need to carry a duplicate device (e.g., personal smartphone and business smartphone).

####  Q: What is Mobile Device Management (MDM)? 
{: .fs-4 }


##### A: Within our organization, we support many business-owned mobile devices. To ensure these devices are appropriately secured, receiving updates, and have company resources available, our organization required a solution that would allow us to manage all of these devices from a single platform. Within this platform, we can manage Apple, Android, and other types of mobile devices by enrolling this equipment in our MDM solution. Once our MDM solution manages a business-owned device, the endpoint exchanges various pieces of information that allows us to better understand the posture of mobile device(s) across the organization.

####   Q: What is the purpose of a pilot program? 
{: .fs-4 }

##### A: Recently, we have been asked why BYOD is being rolled out as a pilot program instead of becoming a standard for the whole organization. This is a complicated question and can be broken down into a few separate viewpoints. 
{: .bg-grey-lt-000 }

##### A: One of the first reasons that we’re conducting a pilot program for BYOD is it is an entirely new form of device management for this organization. In the past, we as an organization have only needed to worry about corporate-owned assets that were maintained, managed, and replaced by the Information Technology (IT) team. With many employees owning a personal mobile device, it has become inconvenient to carry multiples of the same device(s). Our BYOD pilot program looks to better understand how we can utilize an employee’s device to deliver corporate resources securely. During this pilot, we hope to gain valuable feedback from participants that will help us to better understand how BYOD fits within our organization.

##### A: With any new technology implementation or idea, there is often a price tag associated with making it a reality. With BYOD, there is a significant cost associated with implementing this solution across the organization. While the costs are manageable for the organization from a finance perspective, we need to thoroughly review that BYOD will be a sound investment for our organization. Before committing to a new operating expense, we need to ensure that leadership, IT, and employees participating in the pilot program agree this solution fits well within our organization.
